# ONLY WILL BE PYTHON CODE OF GOOGLE SHEETS/EXCEL AUTOMATION FAILS!

# This will be a section of Python code that manipulates our large dataframe. This will need to call in our dataframe first then we can
# work on it. Will need to have code in place to find the standard deviation between fanduals value and all other combined
# platforms average projection. This will output a new data column in the dataframe called STD. We will use that data collumn to 
# sort the datafram and list the players from lowest STD to highest, also breaking it up based on position aswell.
