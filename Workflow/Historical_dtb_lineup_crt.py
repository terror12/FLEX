# Python code to pull historical data from excel files into Python so that we can split create lineups based on a for loop
# function that needs to be coded.

# We will need to research ways to speed up for loops as much as possible

# Once this code is complete it will generate lineups, along with their total salary and actual points scored
 
# We may have this in a large dataframe or broken up into many different lineup objects 

# We then can list them based on highest actual points scored to lowest.

# We will need to add some type of check for Max and Min salary
