This directory holds the shell scripts that we run to convert our Database from
Google sheets into a csv file holding only the necessary info to analyze the STD.

This info will look like the following.

,Actual_Points,sdPts
33,10.0,2.0
366,10.0,1.0
141,10.0,2.0
26,9.0,2.0
2,6.0,2.0
103,3.0,1.0

With this we can now use the actual points scored and the corresponding assigned
standard deviation that was assigned to the player that had scored those points.
