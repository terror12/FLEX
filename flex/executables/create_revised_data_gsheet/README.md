This directory holds shell scripts for each year. These scripts have a line for
each week that instructs the code to build a new Google Sheet based on the
projections and FanDuel salaries data.

This is not something that should be ran all the time but I have put it into
a script for the case where I have generated all new data and what to
automatically recreate my sheets so that I can start analysis on this new approach.
